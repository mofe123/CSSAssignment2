    <h1> FAVORITE EGBA SNACK-KOKORO </h1>
    <h2> About KOKORO</h2>
    <p> Kokoro is a rod &dash; like shaped crunchy Nigerian snack, popular in some parts of Nigeria. <br>
        It is made with corn meal/corn flour and usually sold by street hawkers.
        <br>I think it is very popular in Abeokuta compare to other states 
        cause i rarely see it in other states.</p>
